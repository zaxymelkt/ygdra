[?] An Error produced when the analysis system does not have the required proccessing power to calculate an opponent's ability.
This is not always indicative of a target's power, sometimes it can be a result of the user's lack of ability.

Monsters evolve at certain Lv milestones. They are reverted back to [Lv1] and increase in [Grade].

A Small Lesser Tararact is a [F Grade Lv1] Monster.
A Small Tararact is a [E Grade Lv1] Monster.

Certain Humanoid species like Dwarfs also evolve, however, that process differs from that of typical monsters.

Humans can evolve, either through monsterification or enlightenment.
